REACT NATIVE + EXPO 


PROJECT SETUP

1 = > yarn create expo-app project-name

2 = > yarn start


=========================================

By default, every view in React Native uses flexbox, event if
you don't assign any special style (it differs from web dev)

In web dev, if you use flexbox the default is a row orientation
But in Native, the default is a column orientation

Buttons do not have style props


To allow user interaction, you need to handle EVENTS
